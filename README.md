# MPC-for-DDMR
This repository contains the program for Model Predictive Control of a differential drive robot. Dynamics model for DDMR contains the control of 10 states. They are: Position, Velocity, Heading angle, Heading angle vleocity, and each wheel's angular velocity. 

To verify the dynamics , run the `robot.py` file with appropriate initial conditions and simulation time. It will plot the robot trajectory for those conditions. 


``` 
python robot.py

```
